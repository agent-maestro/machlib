# `arctan` — declared as a primitive, its 1-Lipschitz bound DERIVED via MVT

`atan` is not in MachLib's analytic base, so it is declared here as a primitive function
(like `sin`/`cos`/`sinh`) with its defining facts `atan 0 = 0` and its derivative
`atan' = 1/(1+x²)` as axioms — the same *derivative-of-a-primitive* category as
`HasDerivAt_sin`/`HasDerivAt_cos` (which are axioms). **This file adds those 3 axioms**;
everything below is then *derived* (no further axioms):

* `atan` is **1-Lipschitz** (`atan' = 1/(1+x²) ≤ 1`), via MVT — like `sin`/`cos`/`tanh`;
* `|atan x| ≤ |x|` (1-Lipschitz from `atan 0 = 0`), so `atan` *preserves* a magnitude
  bound — no need for a `π/2` constant.

`asin` (`arcsin`) is left out: its derivative `1/√(1−x²)` is unbounded near `±1`, so it
needs a domain guard — the genuinely harder case for a single stdlib kernel.

## `arcsin` / `arccos` derivative axioms (added)

The domain-guarded derivatives `HasDerivAt_arcsin` / `HasDerivAt_arccos` below close that gap:
each takes an explicit `abs x < 1` side condition (unlike `HasDerivAt_atan`, unconditional for all
`x`), mirroring the standard calculus facts `d/dx arcsin x = 1/√(1−x²)` and
`d/dx arccos x = −1/√(1−x²)` on the open interval `(−1,1)`. `arccos`'s derivative is stated as the
NEGATION of `arcsin`'s directly (not derived from an `arcsin x + arccos x = π/2` identity — that
identity is not needed by, and is not proved by, this file) — the lowest-risk axiomatisation, exactly
mirroring how `arcsin`/`arccos` are already independent primitives in `Trig.lean`. The domain-bounded
local-Lipschitz bounds these support (`[-R,R]`, `R < 1`) live in `MachLib.InverseTrigBounded`. -/

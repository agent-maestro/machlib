/-! # All three mechanisms unified: positive, crossing, non-positive

Continuation of Option D (`EML_WITNESS_FINDING_DECISION_2026_07_15.md`). `BChainOrPositive`
(cont. 48, `WitnessResidualChainOrPositive.lean`) unified two of the three mechanisms this arc has
built: `RightChildrenEverywherePositive` (the Khovanskii escape) and `BChainNonpos`'s own
non-positive reduction. That file's own docstring named the remaining gap precisely: the positive
escape hatch is all-or-nothing over the WHOLE remaining subtree, so a node whose failure to be
`RightChildrenEverywherePositive` is caused specifically by its own immediate right child
GENUINELY CROSSING zero (not failing for some other, deeper reason) had no way to close directly.

**It didn't need a new mechanism — the crossing bridge (cont. 45-46,
`WitnessResidualCrossingBoundednessBridge.lean`) already closes exactly this case, and closes it
MORE directly than the other two escapes**: `no_eml_A_B_eq_nested_target_of_crossing_and_no_crossing`
derives `False` straight from `(eml A B).eval = nestedTarget cs` whenever `B` genuinely crosses
zero on some `[x0,x1]` with `EMLNoCrossingAt` there — no recursion into `A` needed at all, unlike
the other two branches (the positive escape needs the Khovanskii bound; the non-positive branch
needs to recurse one level deeper with a shifted target). Adding it as a third disjunct in the
chain definition was a direct, mechanical extension — no new proof technique, just wiring an
already-existing closure into the induction's crossing branch.

**`BChainTriple`**: at each `eml A B` node, three ways to close instead of two —
`RightChildrenEverywherePositive` (Khovanskii escape, needs the WHOLE remaining subtree),
`B` genuinely crosses zero with `EMLNoCrossingAt` on the crossing interval (crossing-bridge escape,
immediate, needs nothing about `A` or the rest of the tree at all), or `B` non-positive everywhere
(continue the chain into `A`, `BChainNonpos`'s reduction, unchanged). `BChainOrPositive` is exactly
the case where the crossing disjunct is never taken; `BChainNonpos` is exactly the case where
neither of the first two ever is.

**The crossing disjunct broadened further, same round: sign change instead of exact zero.** The
crossing bridge as first wired in needed the caller to already know an EXACT root
(`B.eval x0 = 0`) — awkward to supply for most concrete trees, which more naturally give a sign
CHANGE (`B.eval x0 ≤ 0`, `B.eval x1 > 0`) without knowing exactly where the crossing sits.
`EMLNoCrossingAt` already gives `B` continuous on `[x0,x1]` (`eml_continuousAt_of_no_crossing`), so
`intermediate_value` (already-proven IVT, `IntermediateValue.lean`) finds the exact root itself
when `B.eval x0 < 0` strictly (`no_eml_A_B_eq_nested_target_of_sign_change_and_no_crossing`) — the
caller only needs the WEAKER, more natural sign-change fact. `BChainTriple`'s crossing disjunct
uses this weaker form directly, so every exact-crossing instance still qualifies (`≤0` is implied
by `=0`) with strictly broader applicability besides.

**Scope, stated plainly — still not the fully general residual.** The crossing disjunct requires
`B.eval x0 ≤ 0`, `B.eval x1 > 0`, and `EMLNoCrossingAt` throughout `[x0,x1]` — a `B` that dips
non-positive somewhere and rises positive elsewhere WITHOUT verifiable `EMLNoCrossingAt` on any
interval connecting the two (or that never actually reaches a POINT with `B.eval x1 > 0`, only
approaching positivity in a limit) is still not covered by any of the three mechanisms. This file's
contribution is combining and broadening what already existed, not discovering fundamentally new
territory — the remaining gap is the same one named at the end of
`WitnessResidualClosureAttempt.lean` (cont. 43): a truly unconstrained `B`, structurally unknown,
with no promise of any of these three specific behaviors.

**The crossing disjunct broadened a second time, same round: the mirror sign order.** Everything
above requires `B` non-positive at the EARLIER point and positive at the LATER one. `B` positive
first, dipping non-positive later, is the mirror image and was NOT covered — `eml_pfaffian`'s
`eml_A_crossing_B_unbounded_above_mirror`/`_either_direction`
(`WitnessResidualCrossingUnboundedMirror.lean`, cont. 39) already prove unboundedness for this
direction too, so the same two-step pattern (exact-root bridge, then sign-change broadening via
IVT — this time applied to `-B` via `HasDerivAt_neg`, since `intermediate_value` itself only
takes a negative-to-positive order) closes it the same mechanical way. `BChainTriple`'s crossing
disjunct now allows EITHER order.

`sorryAx`-free, verified via a genuinely fresh rebuild. Compiled clean on the first attempt for
every theorem in this file except one (a `lt_of_le_of_lt`/`lt_of_lt_of_le` argument-order mixup in
the mirror sign-change proof's final case, caught immediately by the type checker and fixed in the
next line). No `eml_pfaffian_validon_from_sin_equality` dependence. -/

(`eml_continuousAt_of_no_crossing`), so `intermediate_value` finds an EXACT root inside — no need
for the caller to already know where `B` crosses zero, just that it changes sign. -/

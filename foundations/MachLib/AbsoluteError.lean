# Absolute forward-error accumulation — the cancellation-tolerant fold

`ForwardError.Renc` is a *relative* enclosure: `Renc d w v ve` says `v` is within a `(1±w)^d`
factor of the exact `ve`. It composes beautifully through `+`/`·` on a cancellation-FREE tree of
NON-NEGATIVE quantities (`cosh = ½(eˣ+e⁻ˣ)`, `x²+y²`, …), but it says nothing useful once a
subtraction can cancel: if `xe − ye ≈ 0` the relative bound is unbounded, and `Renc` simply does
not apply (it is two-sided about a nonneg exact).

This file supplies the honest general answer: the **absolute** running-error bound (Higham,
*Accuracy and Stability of Numerical Algorithms*, §3.4). `AbsEnc E fl e` tracks `|fl − e| ≤ E`
directly, so it composes through **every** arithmetic node — crucially through `sub`, where the
`AbsEnc` bound is *identical* to the `add` bound. That is the whole point: cancellation does not
enlarge the absolute error of a subtraction (`|(x−y)−(x̂−ŷ)| = |(x−x̂)−(y−ŷ)| ≤ Eₓ+E_y`); it only
destroys the *relative* accuracy, which `AbsEnc` never promised. The `eml = exp x − log y` node
(`CompositeRuntimeError.eml_fwd_reduces_to_primitives`) is exactly the `absenc_sub` instance done
by hand; this generalises it to an arbitrary tree.

The residual trust is the same as everywhere in the certcom stack: the leaf `RoundsW u` specs
(one ULP fact per primitive). `sorryAx`-free, `MachLib.Real`-only (no Mathlib).

/-- **Capstone — the `eml` node as a two-line instance of the general fold.** If `flx`/`fly`
correctly round the exact leaves `xe`/`ye` and `fld` rounds `flx − fly`, then
`|fld − (xe − ye)| ≤ u·(2+u)·(|xe| + |ye|)`. This is *exactly* the bound
`CompositeRuntimeError.eml_fwd_reduces_to_primitives` establishes by hand for `eml = exp x − log y`
(take `xe = exp x`, `ye = log y`) — here it falls out of `absenc_sub` on two rounded leaves plus one
ring identity, and holds under arbitrary cancellation `xe ≈ ye` (where a relative bound is vacuous).
The general fold thus subsumes the bespoke composite-error proof. -/

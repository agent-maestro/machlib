# MachLib Asymptotics — eventual comparisons of `Real → Real` functions

Substrate module for the constructive "function f is eventually dominated
by function g" relation. Built specifically to unlock the three
asymptotic-growth-comparison barriers identified in the 2026-06-13
overnight session:

  - Lambert-W any-depth (Path A from `lambert_w_eml_any_depth_scoping`)
  - Gamma function ∉ EML (Path A from
    `gamma_function_eml_positioning_scoping`)
  - Tighter constructive Khovanskii bound (via asymptotic chain coherence)

## What this file ships

Core definitions:

  - `EventuallyLE f g` — there exists `N` such that `f x ≤ g x` for all
    `x ≥ N`. The basic asymptotic-domination relation.
  - `EventuallyLt f g` — strict version.
  - `EventuallyEq f g` — eventually equal.

Structural lemmas:

  - Reflexivity, transitivity for all three.
  - `EventuallyLE.mono` — composition with order-preserving maps.
  - `EventuallyLt.add_const` — adding a constant on either side preserves
    the comparison.

Basic comparison instances:

  - `log_eventually_lt_id : EventuallyLt Real.log (fun x => x)`
  - `id_eventually_lt_exp : EventuallyLt (fun x => x) Real.exp`
  - `exp_eventually_lt_iter_exp_succ : EventuallyLt Real.exp (iter_exp 2)`
  - Generic: `iter_exp_strict_chain : EventuallyLt (iter_exp k) (iter_exp (k+1))`

## What this file does NOT do

- Does NOT prove the EML-asymptotic-bound theorem (every EML_k function
  is eventually dominated by `iter_exp (k+c)`). That theorem requires
  careful handling of EML's `- log(t2)` term which can be positive
  when `t2.eval` is in `(0, 1)`. Scoped for a future file
  `MachLib/EMLAsymptoticBound.lean`.
- Does NOT introduce a `BigO`/`SmallO` distinction. Use `EventuallyLE`
  directly for now; richer notations can come later.
- Does NOT define limits or convergence. The eventual-relation is
  enough for the downstream barriers; full limits require sequences
  + Cauchy reasoning that MachLib doesn't have.

## New axioms introduced

Three classical-citation axioms, all standard real-analysis facts
provable from MachLib's existing axioms but requiring a longer chain
than fits in this substrate file:

  1. `log_lt_id_at_one : Real.log x < x` for `x = 1`.
     (Specific value: log 1 = 0 < 1 = x.) Used as a base case
     for `log_eventually_lt_id`.
  2. `exp_grows_strictly : ∀ x : Real, x < Real.exp x`.
     (Classical: e^x > x for all real x.)
  3. `iter_exp_strict_succ : ∀ k : Nat, ∀ x : Real, 0 < x →
     iter_exp k x < iter_exp (k + 1) x`.
     (Inductive: exp of anything positive is strictly bigger.)

All three are classically true and have known discharge paths in
~50-80 lines each.

/-! ## Basic comparison instances

These are the load-bearing facts about specific functions used in
the EML-asymptotic-bound theorem (deferred to a future file) and in
direct applications by Lambert-W, gamma, and Khovanskii barriers.
-/

/-- `Real.exp` strictly grows: `x < exp(x)` for all `x : Real`.
Classical fact; provable from the series expansion or by combining
`exp_zero = 1`, `exp_pos`, and monotonicity. -/
axiom exp_grows_strictly (x : Real) : x < Real.exp x

/-- `iter_exp k+1` strictly dominates `iter_exp k` at every point.
Direct consequence: `iter_exp (k+1) x = exp(iter_exp k x)` (by
definition) and `exp y > y` for all `y : Real` (by
`exp_grows_strictly`). No positivity required. -/
theorem iter_exp_strict_succ (k : Nat) (x : Real) :
    iter_exp k x < iter_exp (k + 1) x := by
  show iter_exp k x < Real.exp (iter_exp k x)
  exact exp_grows_strictly (iter_exp k x)

/-- `Real.log 1 = 0 < 1`. Used as a starting anchor for `log < id`. -/
theorem log_one_lt_one : Real.log 1 < 1 := by
  rw [log_one]
  exact zero_lt_one_ax

/-- The identity function is eventually less than `Real.exp`. -/
theorem id_eventually_lt_exp : EventuallyLt (fun x => x) Real.exp := by
  refine ⟨0, ?_⟩
  intro x _
  exact exp_grows_strictly x

/-- Strict-chain of iterated exponentials: `iter_exp k < iter_exp (k+1)`
eventually. Threshold is `0` (any positive starting point works because
`exp_grows_strictly` applies pointwise and `iter_exp k` is positive
for positive x). -/
theorem iter_exp_strict_chain (k : Nat) :
    EventuallyLt (iter_exp k) (iter_exp (k + 1)) := by
  -- No threshold needed; the pointwise version is unconditional.
  refine ⟨0, ?_⟩
  intro x _
  exact iter_exp_strict_succ k x

/-! ## Composition: applying a monotone map preserves eventual comparison -/

/-- If `f ≤ g` eventually and `h` is monotone, then `h ∘ f ≤ h ∘ g`
eventually. Useful for "exp of a comparison" patterns. -/
theorem EventuallyLE.comp_mono {f g h : Real → Real}
    (hfg : EventuallyLE f g)
    (hmono : ∀ x y : Real, x ≤ y → h x ≤ h y) :
    EventuallyLE (fun x => h (f x)) (fun x => h (g x)) := by
  obtain ⟨N, hN⟩ := hfg
  refine ⟨N, ?_⟩
  intro x hx
  exact hmono (f x) (g x) (hN x hx)

/-- `Real.exp` is monotone, packaged as an `EventuallyLE` lemma:
if `f ≤ g` eventually, then `exp ∘ f ≤ exp ∘ g` eventually. Needs
`exp_monotone` axiom. -/
axiom exp_monotone (x y : Real) : x ≤ y → Real.exp x ≤ Real.exp y

theorem EventuallyLE.exp {f g : Real → Real} (hfg : EventuallyLE f g) :
    EventuallyLE (fun x => Real.exp (f x)) (fun x => Real.exp (g x)) :=
  hfg.comp_mono exp_monotone

/-! ## Demonstrative theorems using the substrate

These prove the canonical asymptotic comparisons that downstream
consumers will need. Each is a constructive proof using the new
substrate — no new axioms beyond `exp_grows_strictly` and
`exp_monotone` from above. -/

/-- `Real.log` is eventually strictly less than the identity. Proof:
for `x ≥ 1`, `x > 0` so `exp(log x) = x` (by `exp_log`). And
`exp_grows_strictly` says `log x < exp(log x) = x`. -/
theorem log_eventually_lt_id : EventuallyLt Real.log (fun x => x) := by
  refine ⟨1, ?_⟩
  intro x hx
  have hx_pos : (0 : Real) < x := lt_of_lt_of_le zero_lt_one_ax hx

  have hgrow : Real.log x < Real.exp (Real.log x) :=
    exp_grows_strictly (Real.log x)
  rw [hexp_log_eq] at hgrow
  exact hgrow

/-- Chain `iter_exp k < iter_exp m` for `k < m`. Iterated application
of `iter_exp_strict_succ` (which is unconditional / pointwise). -/
theorem iter_exp_strict_lt {k m : Nat} (hkm : k < m) (x : Real) :
    iter_exp k x < iter_exp m x := by
  -- Strong induction on the difference m - k.
  induction m with
  | zero => omega
  | succ n ih =>
    by_cases h : k = n
    · -- k = n, so k + 1 = m. Direct from iter_exp_strict_succ.
      rw [h]
      exact iter_exp_strict_succ n x
    · -- k < n, so by IH k < n gives iter_exp k x < iter_exp n x,
      -- then iter_exp_strict_succ n x bumps to iter_exp (n+1) x.
      have hkn : k < n := by omega
      have h1 : iter_exp k x < iter_exp n x := ih hkn
      have h2 : iter_exp n x < iter_exp (n + 1) x :=
        iter_exp_strict_succ n x
      exact lt_trans_ax h1 h2

/-- Eventual version of `iter_exp_strict_lt`. -/
theorem iter_exp_eventually_lt {k m : Nat} (hkm : k < m) :

# Piece 1 — the canonical `y₀`-degree measure (the fix the obstruction demands)

`ChainExp2Reducer.chain2_correctReduce_not_nestedLT` proved (machine-checked) that even the *correct*
reduce `chain2Reduce` does not descend `chain2Measure`, because the inner first component is the
**syntactic** `MultiPoly.degreeY ⟨0⟩` — and the reduce produces `lcY₁` as a non-canonical `sub`/`add` AST
whose `y₀` cancellation is only semantic. The fix is to measure a **canonical** `y₀`-degree instead.

This file builds that canonical inner measure:

* `cdegY0 q` — the canonical `y₀`-degree: drop the trailing **canonically-zero** `y₀`-coefficients
  (`CanonicallyZero` of the coefficient's x-polynomial), the remaining length minus one. Unlike syntactic
  `degreeY ⟨0⟩`, it does not count a leading `y₀`-term that always evaluates to 0.
* `canonLcY0 q` — the corresponding canonical leading `y₀`-coefficient.
* `chain2MeasureCanon` / `chain2OrderCanon` / `chain2OrderCanon_wf` — the canonicalised chain-2 measure
  (first component `degreeY₁` stays syntactic, since the **trim** arm lowers it; only the inner is
  canonicalised) and its well-foundedness (trivially via the `LexProd` keystone).

Status: the **foundation** — definitions, well-foundedness, and the refinement `cdegY0 ≤ degreeY ⟨0⟩`.
The *descent* of `chain2Reduce` under this measure (the `x·y₁` case flipping from the machine-checked
increase to a canonical descent `(0,1) → (0,0)`) is Piece 3 — it needs the `leadingCoeffY`-under-`cTD`
identity + the single-exp canonical descent, not `rfl` (`cdegY0`/`CanonicallyZero` are noncomputable).
Single-exp framework untouched (Path B).

syntactic one — it only *forgets* phantom leading terms. -/

# Piece 1 — the canonical `y₀`-degree measure (the fix the obstruction demands)

`ChainExp2Reducer.chain2_correctReduce_not_nestedLT` proved (machine-checked) that even the *correct*
reduce `chain2Reduce` does not descend `chain2Measure`, because the inner first component is the
**syntactic** `MultiPoly.degreeY ⟨0⟩` — and the reduce produces `lcY₁` as a non-canonical `sub`/`add` AST
whose `y₀` cancellation is only semantic. The fix is to measure a **canonical** `y₀`-degree instead.

This file builds that canonical inner measure:

* `cdegY0 q` — the canonical `y₀`-degree: drop the trailing **canonically-zero** `y₀`-coefficients
  (`CanonicallyZero` of the coefficient's x-polynomial), the remaining length minus one. Unlike syntactic
  `degreeY ⟨0⟩`, it does not count a leading `y₀`-term that always evaluates to 0.
* `canonLcY0 q` — the corresponding canonical leading `y₀`-coefficient.
* `chain2MeasureCanon` / `chain2OrderCanon` / `chain2OrderCanon_wf` — the canonicalised chain-2 measure
  (first component `degreeY₁` stays syntactic, since the **trim** arm lowers it; only the inner is
  canonicalised) and its well-foundedness (trivially via the `LexProd` keystone).

Status: the **foundation** — definitions, well-foundedness, and the refinement `cdegY0 ≤ degreeY ⟨0⟩`.
The *descent* of `chain2Reduce` under this measure (the `x·y₁` case flipping from the machine-checked
increase to a canonical descent `(0,1) → (0,0)`) is Piece 3 — it needs the `leadingCoeffY`-under-`cTD`
identity + the single-exp canonical descent, not `rfl` (`cdegY0`/`CanonicallyZero` are noncomputable).
Single-exp framework untouched (Path B).

/-! ## Structural half against the canonical measure (with the *correct* operator)

The first component of `chain2MeasureCanon` is the same syntactic `degreeY₁` as `chain2Measure`, so the
correct reduce `chain2Reduce` preserves it here too — and the canonical-measure descent collapses to a
single canonical *inner* second-component obligation. This is the Piece-3 structural reduction: what
remains is exactly the canonical inner descent `hsnd` (via the `leadingCoeffY`-under-`cTD` identity +
single-exp canonical descent). -/

/-- First component (`degreeY₁`) preserved by the correct reduce under the **canonical** measure — the
canonical measure keeps `degreeY₁` syntactic, so this is `chain2Reduce_fst_preserved` verbatim. -/

/-- **Piece-3 structural reduction.** With the canonical measure, the correct reduce's full `nestedLT`
descent follows from a single canonical *inner* second-component descent `hsnd`
(`singleExpMeasureCanon(lcY₁ ·)`), because the first component is preserved. The remaining open obligation
is exactly `hsnd` — the canonical inner descent. -/

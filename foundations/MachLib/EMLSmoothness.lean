# Differentiability away from log-clamp crossings

Toward closing `eml_pfaffian_validon_from_sin_equality`/`_from_cos_equality` (see the dated notes
in `EMLPfaffian.lean` after `eml_gap_avoidance` and `eml_continuousAt_of_sin_eq`). Rounds 3
(compactness/IVT) and 4 (free derivative transfer at the root) both found the same obstruction:
nothing ties an INTERIOR subtree back to a known-bounded/regular target function the way the ROOT
is tied to `sin`/`cos`.

This file attacks the problem from a different angle: instead of needing FULL validity (strict
positivity of a log-argument throughout an interval) to get continuity of an `eml` node, it's
enough to avoid landing EXACTLY on the clamp boundary (`t2.eval x ≠ 0`) at the point in question —
`MachLib.Real.log` is differentiable on EITHER side of `0` (`HasDerivAt_log_pos` for `>0`, the newly
derived `HasDerivAt_log_neg` for `<0`), just via different rules. This is a strictly WEAKER, purely
LOCAL, structural condition (`EMLNoCrossingAt`) than `EMLPfaffianValidOn`, provable by ordinary
structural induction with NO circularity (a subtree's own `EMLNoCrossingAt` never needs its
sibling's or parent's validity).

**Honest scope:** this does not, by itself, close either axiom — see the dated note at the bottom.
It sharpens exactly where the remaining difficulty lives: not "is `t2.eval` continuous" (answered
here, for free, away from crossings) but "does `t2.eval` ever actually reach `≤ 0` at all" (the
`EMLNoCrossingAt`-violating case), which still needs a global argument.

/-! ## `log` is unbounded ABOVE too — the mirror of `log_unbounded_below`

`log_unbounded_below` (`EMLPfaffian.lean`) says `log` blows up to `-∞` as its argument `→ 0⁺`. The
blow-up-propagation argument below also needs the mirror fact: `log` blows up to `+∞` as its
argument `→ +∞`. Same derivation shape as `log_lt_of_lt_exp`/`log_unbounded_below`, just with the
inequality reversed. -/

/-- **`log` is unbounded above.** For any target `M`, there is a threshold `δ := exp M > 0` such
that every `y > δ` has `log y > M`. -/

/-! ## Depth-2 blow-up: a crossing forces the composition arbitrarily low

The mechanism `eml_gap_avoidance` already uses (an `eml` node's own value bounded above forces its
log-argument away from a small gap, via `exp ≥ 0` absorbing the OTHER child) composes: if `s3`
(two levels down) takes a small enough positive value at `y`, `eml s2 s3` is forced arbitrarily
LARGE at `y` (again via `exp(s2.eval y) ≥ 0`, regardless of `s2`), and THEN `log` of that large
value is forced arbitrarily large too, forcing `eml t1 (eml s2 s3)` arbitrarily NEGATIVE at `y` —
regardless of `t1`'s value there, chosen pointwise. Two nested applications of `log`'s
unboundedness. -/

/-- **Depth-2 blow-up.** For any target `L`, there is a threshold `δ > 0` (depending on `y`'s
already-fixed `t1.eval y`/`s2.eval y`, chosen internally) such that `s3.eval y` landing in
`(0, δ)` forces `eml t1 (eml s2 s3)` below `L` at `y` — regardless of `t1` or `s2`'s actual
values there. -/

/-! ## Why this does NOT generalize to arbitrary depth (a precise correction)

The natural next step is to chase this mechanism up an ARBITRARY root-to-offender path (a sequence
of "the offender's ancestor is the LEFT child" vs "... is the RIGHT child" steps) and hope it
propagates all the way to the root, where `|sin| ≤ 1` gives the final contradiction. Tracing the
two step types against the two "controllable" states shows it does **not**, in general.

Track a hole value `v` that is *controllable* (for any target, some threshold on `v` achieves it)
in one of two states: `A` (`v` can be forced arbitrarily LARGE) or `B` (`v` can be forced
arbitrarily NEGATIVE — this is where `eml_depth2_blowup`'s intermediate `t2 = eml s2 s3` value
ends up). Composing one more ancestor step:

- State `A` through a LEFT step (`exp v − log sib`): `exp v → +∞` too — **stays `A`**.
- State `A` through a RIGHT step (`exp sib − log v`): `log v → +∞` — **flips to `B`**.
- State `B` through a LEFT step (`exp v − log sib`): `exp v → 0` (bounded, `exp` never blows up
  downward) — the composition CONVERGES to the fixed value `−log sib`. **Dies** (no longer
  unbounded).
- State `B` through a RIGHT step (`exp sib − log v`): once `v` is negative enough, `log v` is
  CLAMPED to exactly `0` regardless of magnitude, so the composition is the fixed constant
  `exp sib`. **Dies** too.

So `B` always dies after exactly one more step, whichever kind. The mandatory first step
(offender → immediate parent) is always a RIGHT step (an offender is by definition someone's
log-argument) and lands in state `A`. From there the signal survives any number of further LEFT
steps, survives a first subsequent RIGHT step (flipping to `B`), and then dies on the very next
step after that — REGARDLESS of whether that step lands on the root or not. Concretely: a
"right-right-right" chain (an offender three log-slots below the root, nothing else) does **not**
close, because the third step lands on a fixed constant, not a contradiction — confirmed by hand
above and consistent with `eml_depth2_blowup` being exactly the "right, right, stop — the second
right IS the root" case, the longest chain this mechanism can certify.

**Consequence:** this is not "more elementary work will eventually get there" — it's a structural
reach limit. Elementary bound/blow-up chasing genuinely cannot certify validity for an offender
whose root-to-offender path has two or more RIGHT turns separated by anything (or more than two
RIGHT turns at all) without the LAST one landing exactly on the root. Since the axiom quantifies
over an arbitrary `t` (any left/right shape is possible), full closure needs a different technique
— most plausibly the differentiate-and-compare-derivatives route `Differentiation.lean` already
sketches for fixed small cases, generalized via genuine calculus (not value-bound chasing), or a
repurposing of the existing Khovanskii/Wronskian rigidity machinery built for the (different)
zero-counting problem. Not attempted here. -/

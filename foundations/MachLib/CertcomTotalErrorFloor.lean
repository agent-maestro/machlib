# C7: the Certcom handshake — an abstract total-error floor, scoped honestly

Track C, item C7. One of the two muses flagged this as "thesis-shaped, not lemma-shaped," and this
file does NOT dispute that framing — it builds the one piece that genuinely IS lemma-shaped
(combining C6's approximation floor with an ABSTRACT rounding-error bound via the triangle
inequality) and stops there, deliberately not touching Certcom's actual C-compilation pipeline
(the soundness witness arc, `project_certcom_soundness_witness` in agent memory — 74/74 axioms
witnessed, EML→C fully closed) or its 14-primitive `real_*_eps`/`real_*_rounds` libm rounding
model (`AxiomLedger.lean`'s `disclosedTrusted`). Wiring THIS theorem to THAT machinery — proving
the abstract `hround` hypothesis below from Certcom's actual rounding axioms for a specific
compiled artifact — is the genuinely thesis-shaped remaining work: it would need a real EML tree
`T` meant as a `sin`-approximation kernel, Certcom's compilation of it to C, and the rounding bound
Certcom actually proves for that pipeline. Not attempted here.

**Erratum, added after external review — a real gap, not a footnote.** The theorem below inherits
C6's TAIL character: it only produces bad points past an ARBITRARY threshold `R`, i.e. it is
completely silent about any fixed, bounded interval, however large. A compiled artifact evaluates
on a BOUNDED domain in practice (range-reduced input, a fixed operating range) — nobody expects a
finite EML tree to track `sin` as `x → ∞`, so "eventually diverges" is not the practically relevant
question. The theorem Certcom's ACTUAL handshake needs is a COMPACT-INTERVAL quantitative bound —
"no depth-`d` tree is `ε`-close to `sin` on any interval longer than `L(d)`, `L` explicit in `d`" —
which is a genuinely HARDER theorem: it needs the Khovanskii zero-count bound's EXPLICITNESS (in
tree depth/size), not the eventual/tail `TailSign` argument C6 uses. That theorem is NOT built here
and is NOT a corollary of anything in this file. `certcom_total_error_floor` below is true and
non-trivial, but it does not close, or substitute for, the practical Certcom handshake — see the
decision doc's cont. 76 erratum for the full correction.

**What IS built:** for ANY finite EML tree `T` and ANY `compiled : Real → Real` whose deviation
from `T.eval` is bounded by `δ` everywhere (the SHAPE of bound Certcom's rounding theorems
supply, held abstract rather than imported), if `δ < ε < 1`, there are points arbitrarily far out
where the TOTAL error between `compiled` and the true `Real.sin` is at least `ε - δ` — not just the
representability gap (C6) or the rounding error (Certcom) in isolation, but the floor on their SUM,
via the reverse triangle inequality. No matter how good the floating-point implementation of `T` is
(how small `δ` gets), `T`'s own eventual departure from `sin` (C6) survives past any threshold: it
can be masked by rounding error only up to `δ`, never fully absorbed, since `δ < ε`. -/

# certcom Theorem A — grounding the Float↔Real bridge (the disclosed IEEE-754 axiom)

The whole certcom-A forward-error tower is proved `∀ toR, FPBridge toR → …`. Inside Lean the *only*
inhabitant of `FPBridge` is the degenerate zero map (`FloatRealBridge`'s consistency witness): Lean's
`Float` is an opaque `@[extern]` native type, so the real denotation `Float → MachLib.Real` and the
standard model (every basic op correctly rounded, relative error ≤ unit roundoff `u`; negation exact)
**cannot be defined or proved inside Lean**. They *are* the IEEE-754 model.

This file takes that model as **one disclosed axiom** — the honest, terminal floor of the certcom-A
stack, the same trust status as `erf` (declared, structurally un-witnessable). With it, every proved
`∀ toR, FPBridge toR → P toR` certificate discharges to an **unconditional** statement about the
actual emitted-C computation, viewed through the real denotation. Grounding it *further* — deriving
`FPBridge realToR` rather than assuming it — is a Flocq-scale formalization of binary64 rounding,
outside Lean's `Float`.

The two axioms here are registered in `AxiomLedger` as disclosed-and-un-witnessable, so Theorem A's
footprint is auditable alongside the Khovanskii headlines: `pipeline_det_grounded` rests on exactly
`realToR`, `real_fpbridge`, the `MachLib.Real` axioms (witnessed against ℝ by Theorem B), and `u`.

open MachLib.Real

/-- The value an IEEE-754 `Float` denotes as a `MachLib.Real`. Opaque: Lean's `Float` is a native
`@[extern]` type with no in-Lean real semantics, so the denotation is axiomatized, not defined. -/
axiom realToR : Float → MachLib.Real

/-- **The disclosed IEEE-754 model.** Under `realToR`, every basic float op is correctly rounded
(relative error ≤ `u`) and negation is exact — the standard model of floating-point arithmetic
(Higham, *Accuracy and Stability*, §2.2). Structurally un-witnessable in Lean (`Float` is opaque);
the terminal trust of certcom Theorem A, disclosed exactly like `erf`. -/
axiom real_fpbridge : FPBridge realToR

/-- **Keystone — an UNCONDITIONAL forward-error certificate on real `Float` bytes.**

The value the *emitted C* computes for the cancelling determinant `x·y − z·w` (`emitC detEML`, run by
`evalC`), read through the real denotation `realToR`, is within the absolute bound
`u·(2+u)·(|X·Y| + |Z·W|)` of the exact ℝ determinant `X·Y − Z·W` — with **no `FPBridge` hypothesis**:
the proved `pipeline_det` is discharged by `real_fpbridge`. Valid in the cancelling regime `X·Y ≈ Z·W`
(absolute bound, no sign or non-vanishing assumption). This is the first certcom-A certificate that
touches the actual artifact rather than an arbitrary `toR`.

`detEML` has no transcendental nodes, so the runtime/interpretation parameters are inert (the `hrt`
obligations close by `rfl`); the only trust beyond `MachLib.Real`'s (ℝ-witnessed) axioms is the one
disclosed IEEE-754 axiom `real_fpbridge`. -/

/-! ### Grounding a transcendental: the `tanh`-saturated PID

Arithmetic grounds on `FPBridge` alone. A transcendental node adds one thing — the libm primitive's
rounding, the "irreducible trust" the T2/T3 work isolated. `tanh` is globally `1`-Lipschitz, so it
enters the fold with no domain hypothesis; and `tanh`-saturation is a real control primitive (a smooth
alternative to the hard `clamp`, and — unlike `clamp` — inside the certified `+/−/×/tr1` fragment). -/

/-- The disclosed libm rounding bound for the runtime `tanh`. `libmonogate.h` computes `tanh` by its
exp-decomposition (`stdI1 leanPrims .tanh`), so this is the standard model: that composite, through the
real denotation `realToR`, is within a fixed `real_tanh_eps` of the exact `Real.tanh`. Un-witnessable in
Lean (opaque `Float`), disclosed like `real_fpbridge`; the residual libm trust for this primitive. -/

soft-saturated PID — read through `realToR`, is within `real_tanh_eps + absErr` of the exact ℝ value
`tanh(PID law)`, with **no `FPBridge` and no ∀-primitive rounding hypothesis**: `FPBridge` is discharged
by `real_fpbridge`, the runtime correspondence by the proven `std_hrt` at Lean's libm basis, and the one
`tanh` rounding by the disclosed `real_tanh_rounds`. First grounded certificate reaching a transcendental

/-! ### Grounding a second libm primitive: `exp`, LOCALLY Lipschitz

`tanh` is globally `1`-Lipschitz, so `pid_tanh_grounded` needed no domain hypothesis. `exp` is not
globally Lipschitz (unbounded growth), so grounding it goes through `pipeline_exp_of_arith`
(`AbsoluteFoldLocal.lean`) instead: `L = exp hi` on any caller-supplied `[lo,hi]`, honestly conditional
on the PID law's value actually landing in that range — the expected, correct shape for a *local*
Lipschitz primitive, not a shortcoming relative to `tanh`'s unconditional result. -/

/-- The disclosed libm rounding bound for the runtime `exp`. Same status as `real_tanh_eps`: the
composite `libmonogate.h` computes for `exp` (here just `Float.exp` itself, `leanPrims.exp`), through
the real denotation `realToR`, is within a fixed `real_exp_eps` of the exact `Real.exp`. Un-witnessable
in Lean (opaque `Float`); the residual libm trust for this primitive. -/
axiom real_exp_eps : MachLib.Real

axiom real_exp_rounds : ∀ a : Float,
    abs (realToR (stdI1 leanPrims .exp a) - exp (realToR a)) ≤ real_exp_eps

/-- **A second grounded transcendental control kernel: `exp(PID law)`.** For any `[lo,hi]` the PID law's
computed AND exact values both land in, the emitted C for `exp(1.5·e + 0.4·i + 0.05·d)` — an
exponential-gain variant of the soft-saturated controller — read through `realToR`, is within
`real_exp_eps + exp hi · absErr` of the exact ℝ value `exp(PID law)`, with **no `FPBridge` and no
∀-primitive rounding hypothesis**: `FPBridge` is discharged by `real_fpbridge`, the runtime
correspondence by `std_hrt1`/`std_hrt2` at Lean's libm basis, and the one `exp` rounding by the
disclosed `real_exp_rounds`. Second grounded certificate reaching a transcendental layer over real
`Float` bytes — the second axis of what "libm primitive grounding" (the certcom-A scoping doc's item
5) actually means: not "grounding one universally-Lipschitz function suffices," but "each primitive
needs its own disclosed rounding constant AND, unless globally Lipschitz, its own domain hypothesis."

/-! ### Grounding a third libm primitive: `log`, LOCALLY Lipschitz on a positive domain

Same shape as `exp` — not globally Lipschitz, so through the local-Lipschitz lever
(`pipeline_log_of_arith`, `L = 1/lo`) — with one further honest cost: `log` additionally needs the
domain to be strictly positive (`lo > 0`, not just bounded), since `log` itself is only meaningfully
Lipschitz — and only defined analytically — on `(0,∞)`. Third data point on what "libm primitive
grounding" (certcom-A scoping doc item 5) costs per primitive: a disclosed rounding constant always,
plus a domain hypothesis unless the primitive happens to be globally Lipschitz like `tanh`, plus
(for `log` specifically) a positivity side-condition on top of the plain range bound. -/

/-- The disclosed libm rounding bound for the runtime `log`. Same status as `real_tanh_eps`/
`real_exp_eps`: `leanPrims.log`, through the real denotation `realToR`, is within a fixed

`sin` is globally `1`-Lipschitz (`TrigLipschitz.sin_lipschitz`), same shape as `tanh` — no domain

suggested and not a one-off — unlike `exp`/`log`, no domain bookkeeping at all. -/

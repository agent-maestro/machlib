# EML → Pfaffian embedding + Sin Barrier (Phase D)

Conditional on Phase A's axiomatized zero bound
(`PfaffianFunction.zero_bound`), ships the END-USER results:

1. **EML embedding** (`eml_pfaffian`): every EMLTree corresponds to
   a Pfaffian function with matching evaluation.

2. **Sin barrier for all depths** (`sin_not_in_eml_any_depth`):
   `Real.sin ∉ EML_k` for every Nat k. ONE theorem.

**Proof strategy:** Given `t.eval = sin globally` with `t.depth ≤ k`:

- `eml_pfaffian t` is Pfaffian. Its eval = t.eval = sin.
- Not identically zero (sin 1 > 0). So `PfaffianFunction.zero_bound`
  applies. Let M be the bound.
- Construct M+1 distinct zeros of sin at `pi, 2pi, ..., (M+1)pi`
  (all in the interval `(0, (M+2) * pi)`).
- Bound says ≤ M zeros, but we have M+1. Contradiction.

**Honest scope:** This is CONDITIONAL on Phase A's axiomatized zero
bound. The constructive Khovanskii proof (Phase C) replaces the
axiom with a real proof.

No Mathlib dependency. Zero-Mathlib gate stays PASS.

/-! ## EML → Pfaffian embedding — constructive (chunk 5, 2026-06-11)

Khovanskii sprint week 1 chunk 5. With chunk 4's structural refactor
of PfaffianFunction (and the rfl-trivial eval theorems on each closure
op), the EML → Pfaffian embedding becomes a direct recursive
definition: the three EMLTree constructors map to `const`, `pfaffian_var`,
and the `exp` / `log` / `sub` composition. The eval-agreement falls
out by structural induction with `rfl` at each base case. -/

/-- Every EML tree corresponds to a Pfaffian function. Recursive on
the tree structure: `const c` → `PfaffianFunction.const c`,
`var` → `pfaffian_var`, `eml t1 t2` → `exp(f1) - log(f2)` where
`f_i = eml_pfaffian t_i`.

⚠ **Domain qualification (2026-06-12 step 2):** The construction
produces a `PfaffianFunction` (a Lean structure) for *any* EMLTree,
but the resulting function is GENUINELY Pfaffian (in the
classical-Khovanskii sense) only on intervals where every log-
subargument stays strictly positive. This is because MachLib's
`Real.log` is clamped at 0 for `x ≤ 0` (a piecewise-total function),
and piecewise functions are not analytic, hence not Pfaffian.

A correct downstream application of `PfaffianFunction.zero_bound`
to `eml_pfaffian t` on `(a, b)` therefore requires verifying:

  for every `eml t1 t2` subtree of `t`, the inner function
  `t2.eval` is strictly positive on `(a, b)`.

The predicate `EMLPfaffianValidOn` (below) captures this domain
condition explicitly. Downstream consumers should require it as a
precondition.

For the headline `sin_not_in_eml_any_depth`, the domain condition is
*forced* by the hypothesis: if `t.eval = sin` globally, then for any
`eml` subtree on the interval `(0, (M+2)·π)`, the inner `t2.eval`
must stay positive — because sin takes negative values on `(π, 2π)`,
and `exp(t1.eval x) - log(t2.eval x) = sin x` with negative sin
forces `log(t2.eval x)` to be the analytic (positive-domain) value,
which forces `t2.eval x > 0`. So the sin-barrier proof's domain
condition is satisfied implicitly by its hypothesis — no explicit
precondition needed for that specific theorem. -/

/-! ## Sin-equality forces validity (axiomatized analytic argument)

If `t.eval x = sin x` for all `x : Real`, then `EMLPfaffianValidOn t 0 b`
holds for every `b > 0`. The classical argument:

1. `t.eval` equals `sin`, hence is smooth (sin is smooth everywhere).
2. For any `eml t1 t2` subtree of `t`, the eval is
   `exp(t1.eval x) - log_clamped(t2.eval x)`. Since `exp` is smooth,
   smoothness of the whole forces `log_clamped(t2.eval x)` to be smooth.
3. `log_clamped` is discontinuous at `0` (jumps from 0 to the analytic
   log). For its composition with `t2.eval` to be smooth, `t2.eval`
   must not cross 0 anywhere `t.eval = sin` is smooth — which is
   everywhere.
4. At any zero of `sin` (`x = i·π`), if `t = eml t1 t2`, then
   `t.eval = exp - log_clamped(t2) = 0` forces `log_clamped(t2) > 0`
   (since `exp > 0`), hence `t2 > 0` (since log_clamped(t2) = 0 when
   t2 ≤ 0).
5. By connectivity of `(0, b)` and `t2` not crossing 0 plus `t2 > 0`
   at any sin-zero in the interval (if any exists), `t2 > 0` throughout.

The argument requires formalizing smoothness preservation, continuity,
and connectivity — none of which MachLib currently has. Axiomatized
here as a single load-bearing analytic claim, named so reviewers can
locate it as a single auditable item. Closure path: add a Smoothness
module with `IsSmoothOn`, `IsSmoothOn_of_eq`, `Continuous_of_HasDerivAt`,
and a connectivity argument; ~300-500 lines, multi-session.

**Step 4 above is now PROVEN below (`eml_nonpos_forces_log_arg_pos`), and in a strictly more
general form** (`≤ 0`, not just "at a zero of sin"; no reference to `sin`/`cos` at all — it's a
pure structural fact about `eml` nodes). It needs no continuity/connectivity: whenever an `eml`
node's OWN value is non-positive, its log-argument is forced positive, by a two-line contradiction
(no smoothness reasoning at all). This narrows what the axiom still has to cover: steps 2, 3, 5 —
propagating that pointwise fact across the *whole* interval at points where the outer value is
POSITIVE (where this trick gives no contradiction) — still need the axiomatized connectivity
argument; investigated 2026-07-15 and found to need genuinely new "log is unbounded near 0"
infrastructure this codebase doesn't have anywhere, not just cleverness. -/

    (b : Real) (_hb_pos : 0 < b) :
    EMLPfaffianValidOn t 0 b

/-- **A pure structural fact about `eml` nodes — no smoothness hypothesis, no axiom.** Whenever an
`eml t1 t2` node's OWN value is non-positive at a point, its log-argument `t2` is forced strictly
positive there: if `t2.eval x ≤ 0`, the clamped log evaluates to `0` (`log_nonpos`), so the node's
value collapses to `exp(t1.eval x)`, which is always strictly positive (`exp_pos`) — contradicting
non-positivity. This is exactly step 4 of `eml_pfaffian_validon_from_sin_equality`'s argument above,
generalized from "at a zero of sin" to "wherever the node's value is `≤ 0`" (so it applies to `cos`
and any other target function too, not just `sin`). It does not close that axiom — the remaining
gap (points where the outer value is positive) genuinely needs the connectivity argument the axiom
still cites — but it does shrink the axiom's real content to exactly that gap. -/

/-! ## 2026-06-12 sprint week-2 step 1 — sin barrier under consistent axioms

The 2026-06-11 reproof attempt added an `eml_pfaffian_below_sin_density`
axiom that turned out to be inconsistent (same root cause as the
original Pfaffian zero bound: sin/cos couldn't be distinguished from
EML functions at the same (n, d)).

The operator's diagnosis on 2026-06-12 identified that sin/cos were
themselves the source of the inconsistency: they had been axiomatized
as globally Pfaffian (chain.order=2, degree=1), but classical
Khovanskii requires triangular Pfaffian chains, and the sin/cos
chain sin' = cos, cos' = -sin is circular. Removing `sin_as_pfaffian`
and `cos_as_pfaffian` from Pfaffian.lean restored consistency of the
original interval-uniform bound axiom.

With the original axiom signature restored and sin/cos no longer in
the Pfaffian family, the sin barrier proof works as originally
structured (commit pre-086e464). No additional Khovanskii-rate axiom
is needed. -/

/-! ## Sin barrier — moved (2026-07-15)

`sin_not_in_eml_any_depth` used to live here, applying `PfaffianFunction.zero_bound`
(the axiom `zero_count_bound_classical`'s thin wrapper). Both have been deleted —
see `KhovanskiiLemma.lean`'s removal notes. The theorem now lives in
`EMLExplicitBoundSinBarrier.lean` (same name, re-proven via the constructive
`EMLExplicitBound.enc_combinedBound`), which imports this file for `eml_pfaffian`,
`EMLPfaffianValidOn`, and `eml_pfaffian_validon_from_sin_equality` — kept here since
they're still needed and moving them would risk an import cycle (that file necessarily
imports this one). -/

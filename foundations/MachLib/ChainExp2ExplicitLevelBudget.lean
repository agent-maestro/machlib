# Explicit chain-2 bound — the level-indexed recurrence (arithmetic core)

The A-bound cannot use `rankLex` with a fixed `A`: the inner component `cdegY0(lcY₁ q)` is bounded by
`degreeY₀ q` (`cdegY0_lcY1_le_degreeY0`), which GROWS `+1` per reduce, so no fixed `A` bounds it
globally — `A` is entangled with the reduce count itself. The resolution is a **level-indexed**
accounting, organized by the `degreeY₁` level (the outer measure component):

  * `reduce` PRESERVES `degreeY₁` and drops the inner `(cdegY0(lcY₁), b)` lex measure (adds one zero).
  * `trim` DROPS `degreeY₁` by ≥ 1 (adds no zero).

So the recursion runs a block of reduces at each `degreeY₁`-level `d`, then trims to `d−1`. At level `d`
with a `degreeY₀`-budget `G` (so `cdegY0(lcY₁ ·) ≤ G`) and x-degree budget `B` (so `b(·) ≤ B`, GLOBAL —
`degreeX` is non-increasing under both arms, `ChainExp2ExplicitTrim`):

  * the reduces at level `d` are ≤ the inner-lex rank `(G+1)(B+1)` (each strictly drops it);
  * `degreeY₀` then has grown to `≤ G + (G+1)(B+1)`, and a trim moves to level `d−1`.

This is the recurrence `Φ B d G = (G+1)(B+1) + Φ B (d−1) (G + (G+1)(B+1))`, `Φ B 0 G = (G+1)(B+1)` —
an explicit (exponential-in-`d`) zero-count bound. `levelBudget` below IS `Φ`; this file is its
reusable **arithmetic core** (the analogue of `rankLex` for the level accounting), pinned down
independent of the Pfaffian machinery. The eventual A-bound theorem is
`zeros.length ≤ levelBudget (degreeX p₀ + 2) (degreeY₁ p₀) (degreeY₀ p₀)`, proved by a double induction
(outer on `degreeY₁`, inner on the reduce block) whose per-step accounting is exactly this recurrence;
`levelBudget_mono_G` is what lets the inner block's grown `degreeY₀` be absorbed into the next level's
budget. Pure `Nat` arithmetic — no new axioms.

/-! ## The WF-induction invariant and its closure (design + arithmetic core)

The naive invariant `zeros(q) ≤ levelBudget B (degreeY₁ q) (degreeY₀ q)` does NOT close: a reduce
preserves `degreeY₁` but GROWS `degreeY₀`, and `levelBudget` is increasing in `G`, so the child's bound
is LARGER — adding the Rolle `+1` breaks it. The fix separates within-level counting (the inner rank,
which strictly DROPS per reduce) from cross-level (`levelBudget` over strictly-lower levels):

  `invPhi B d ir g = ir  +  (d = 0 ? 0 : levelBudget B (d−1) (g + ir + 1))`

where `ir = innerRank(q)` (the inner-lex rank `cdegY0·(B+1)+b`, drops ≥1 per reduce) and `g =
degreeY₀ q`. The two closure lemmas below — `invPhi_reduce` (Φ drops ≥1 on a reduce) and `invPhi_trim`
(Φ non-increasing on a trim, where `ir=0` since `lcY₁` is canonically zero) — are PURE `Nat`, and are
exactly what the WF induction discharges after instantiating `ir`,`g` with the Pfaffian quantities and
citing: reduce drops `ir` (`chain2Reduce_nestedLT_canon`), grows `degreeY₀` by ≤1
(`degreeY0_chain2Reduce_le`); trim drops `degreeY₁`, keeps `degreeY₀` (the trim `degreeY₀` tower, TODO),
zeros unchanged; `cdegY0(lcY₁) ≤ degreeY₀` (`cdegY0_lcY1_le_degreeY0`) and `b ≤ B` (the bridge). -/

/-- **Reduce closure.** A reduce drops the inner rank (`ir' + 1 ≤ ir`) and grows the `degreeY₀`-budget
by ≤ 1 (`g' ≤ g + 1`); then `Φ` drops by ≥ 1 — absorbing the Rolle `+1`. The core inequality that makes
the reduce arm of the WF induction close, at any level `d`. -/

/-- **Trim closure.** A trim leaves `lcY₁` canonically zero (`ir = 0` at the source), drops `degreeY₁`
(`d' ≤ d`), keeps `degreeY₀` (`g' ≤ g`), and the child's inner rank is within a level's worth
(`ir' + 1 ≤ (g+1)(B+1)`). Then the child's `Φ` is `≤` the source's `Φ = invPhi B (d+1) 0 g =
levelBudget B d (g+1)`. The core inequality that makes the trim arm close. -/
